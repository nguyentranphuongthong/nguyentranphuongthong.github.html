      <div>-Creates a cylindrical area of effect in front of Seer which, after 1.4 seconds, hits all enemies inside. The cylinder is 75 meters long and has a diameter of 8 meters.</div>
      <div>-The ability causes the following effects:</div>
      <div>+Interrupts channeled actions such as revives and using healing items.</div>
        <div>+Applies a 1.25 second silence, preventing the use of Legend abilities and canceling those already in progress.</div>
        <div>+Affected enemies' health bars are revealed to the squad for 8 seconds. Enemies see 'MICRO-DRONES DETECTED' on their HUD.</div>
        <div>-Tactical button can be held to delay the launch. This slows player movement by 15% and activates Heart Seeker.</div>

    <div>      
      <div>-A circle is displayed around the crosshair while aiming down sights. When enemies are within a 75 meter, 55° cone in front of Seer, their heartbeat is visualized with orange pulsing and a directional indicator.</div>
      <div>-When an enemy is within 75 m, an orange arrow will be displayed around the circle indicating their direction. When an enemy is within the area bounded by the circle, the whole reticle pulses orange.</div>
      <div>-When an enemy is in player's sight and in the range of 75 m, a blue arrow will be displayed around the circle indicating their direction. When an enemy is within the area bounded by the circle, the whole reticle returns to its normal state.</div>
      <div>-The heartbeat sensor will detect heartbeats through walls within 75m. Beyond that, Seer will need line of sight with the target to detect their heartbeat.</div>
      <div>-At full health, hearts beat every 1.75 seconds. The lower the health, the faster the heart beat. (Shields are irrelevant.)</div>
      <div>-Usable while unarmed or while aiming Focus of Attention.</div>
